paul's suggestions:
connect directly to the pi, spoof sensor data sent from the pi, it's just being stored/loaded in pickle files and sent via udp
try to connect to pi and and spoof tcp messages to issue commands

resource for launching slave on free machine from host: https://answers.ros.org/question/216518/roslaunch-on-slave/

plan:
run a node on neato that is able to connect to another neato
    should be doable, start with calling roslaunch then rosrun from the neato directed at the free one
        may require running roscore?
        may require threading
        may have to just ssh to the new raspi
run basic movement commands, just publish some messages to a topic
    this part supposedly requires TCP connections
obtain sensor data from the slaved neato
    this part should be pickled udp messages, in format of a dictionary when unpickled
